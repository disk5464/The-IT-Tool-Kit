# The-IT-Tool-Kit
Welcome to the IT Tool Kit.
--------------------------------
In this kit, you'll find all sorts of tools to help you, diagnose, quarantine, and fix most basic IT issues. The goal of this kit is for a tech to be able to put it on a flash drive and to be able to take it to any client and to quickly get started troubleshooting the issue instead of wasting time downloading commonly used programs, basically an IT swiss army knife. 

In addition, all of the of the software in this kit was taken straight from the respective developer's website and are free and available to use. None of it has been cracked or pirated. Feel free to upload the files to https://www.virustotal.com if you want to check for viruses and what not. 

If there are any programs that I might have missed and you think should be added feel free to message me

Enjoy
